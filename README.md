## Welcome to the github nerds

I'm currently working as a civilian web developer for the US Air Force (ðŸ«¡), in my free time I'm trying to slog through the Dune books, meandering around outside, and currently building an absolute dogcrap game in C++ using raylib
If you're an employer know that I will bring the same level of professionalism and commitment to work as I do to this incredibly professional GitHub profile
5 Star Culture Hire btw

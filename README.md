## Welcome to the github

I'm currently working as a civilian software developer for the USAF, sadly they don't use GitHub so this site is just side projects, in my free time I'm building some games in C++ using raylib and building an Android app  
Projects in progress:  
Terminal-Roughly finished, need to go through and cleanup code and animations  
InfiniteSky-Working, hitboxes are being a pain so taking a break  
BibleDrillApp-React native app for android that allows people to practice, starting 12/16/2024, writing this for Georgia Baptist Bible Drill and Speakers inc. hope to be testing on play store Februaryish??      

todo: write these up better
